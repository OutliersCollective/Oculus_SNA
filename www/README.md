# early WebVR demo

## About ##

This is a simple demo to display a three.js scene on virtual reality devices
connected to the browser. The demo is derived from Vladimir Vukićevićs [demo
project][ff-cube-demo].

You can find a running example under 
[http://christine-coenen.de/demos/early-webvr-demo/](http://christine-coenen.de/demos/early-webvr-demo/).


## Usage ##

This demo will not run in any release browser. I used nightlies / experimental 
builds of [Chromium][chromium-vr] and [Firefox][firefox-vr]. Both browsers 
should be supported.

The code is likely to break the next weeks or months as the WebVR API is in no 
way stable yet. Also, besides the Oculus Rift no other devices are supported at 
the moment.
